    "# Introduction to stochastic optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The content in this class is based on the book \"Uma Introducção à Otimização sob Incerteza\" by Humberto Bortolossi and Bernardo Pagnoncelli.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About stochastic optimization\n",
    "    \n",
    "Most real-life problems bring uncertainties in themselves: they are inherent in virtually all systems related to actuarial science, economics, meteorology, demography, ecology, and so on. Nowadays, problems involving interactions between man, nature and technology are subject to rapid change, which increases uncertainty. Each new technological revolution brings new challenges to the knowledge established up to then. Even in the deterministic context, there are systems that are complex, which do not allow precise measurement of their parameters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The area of stochastic optimization (also known as optimization under uncertainty) studies methods to address such situations: they incorporate uncertainties in modeling through the inclusion of random variables of known probability distributions. The aim is to find solutions that are acceptable for all possible realizations of the modeled random variables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## The farmer problem\n",
    "\n",
    "John is a farmer with $500$ Hectares (ha) of land available for cultivation. Remember that $500 ha$ equals $5000000 m^2$. He is a specialist in three crops: wheat, maize, and sugarcane. During the winter, he has to decide how much land will be dedicated to each of the three cultures. The figure below shows two possible land divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](Figure1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the size of its property, John has other constraints to consider. He is also the owner of livestock, which needs to be fed. Their livestock needs at least 200 tons (T) of wheat and 240 tons of corn for the ration.  Aside from the wheat and corn produced on his land, he can buy these products from other producers in the local market. Their excess production can be sold to wholesalers, for the price and much smaller because of the profit margin of these traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sugar cane is a crop exclusively for profit: all its production is sold to wholesalers at 36 dollars per tonne (dollars/T). However, the government imposes a production quota of 6,000 T: any quantity produced above this value should be sold for only 10 dollars/T.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on information from previous years, John knows that the average yield of his crops is 2.5, 3.0 and 20 tons per hectare (T/ha). In addition, there is a specific production cost of each crop, which is given in  dollars/ha. The complete model data are shown in the table below:\n",
